-Move things out from datastructure.h that aren't datatstructures anymore like InputContainer
-if configloader is given a nonexistent json path, it just hangs without error message. This needs to be fixed.
-src/ingameelements/projectiles/flashbang.cpp // TODO: Register ult damage
-Use argument=default for optional arguments instead of function name mangling like in spriteloader
-Check that Global can't use std::unique_ptr directly instead of the hack that is the start of main.cpp
-disable jumping on mccree during deadeye
-mccree stun after ult desyncs with weapon a bit

Allegro doesn't support textboxes. GUI libraries exist but they are either complicated to compile or don't support
copy-paste. Both are terrible, am seriously considering writing own text input, as gay as that is. Question is, is there
some easy way to have it happen in a separate window as a separate process that can capture text without blocking networking,
or does the game have to freeze when something is typed in? Or should there be some Global::textbox.update() function?
If so, how does the code that requested something continue?
